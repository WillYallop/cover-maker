# Cover Maker

Cover maker is an open source graphic design web app for creating playlist cover art. It has been developed for Playlist Tools - but is free for all to use.

## Live Demo

Coming soon @ playlisttools.io

## Features
- Supports multiple 'elements' types (these are the images, shapes that can be placed on the artboard).

- Elements can be selected by themeselves or with other elements by shift clicking to allow the user to manipulate the size and location of those elements.

- Elements can be manipulated in a variety of ways, for example: width, height, pos, opacity, backgorund colour (solid & gradient) and many more. These are also dependent on the element type.

- Full layer support so elements can be manually place above and bellow other elements.

- Artboard template support so prebuilt templates can be passed down in initialisation and rendered in the templates tab for user to import.

- Text template support so prebuilt elements can be passed down in initialisation and rendered in the text templates tab for user to import.

- Artboard background can be swapped between solid colour, gradient or image through the background tab.

- Zoom feature to allow you to zoom in and out of your artboard.

- Supports exporting the artboard as either a PNG or JPG, or as a JSON save file.

- Supports importing JSON save files.

- Uses Pexels API to serve high quality images.
